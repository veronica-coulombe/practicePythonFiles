## Project Description

This repository contains a set of simple Python scripts created as practice projects. They are meant to help build understanding of Python fundamentals such as input/output, control flow (conditionals, loops), simple game logic or storytelling, and basic arithmetic operations. These are not production-grade applications, but rather exercises to strengthen coding skills and experiment with Python.

---

## Contents

Here are some of the files/projects included:

| File | Purpose / Description |
|---|---|
| `simpleCalculator.py` | Implements a calculator that takes user input (e.g. numbers and operation) and returns result. |
| `storyGame.py` | An interactive text‑based story game, likely using branching or choices. |
| `arcade.py` | Possibly a simple game or graphical project (using, e.g., the Arcade library) for practicing game‑logic. |

## How to Run the Projects / Examples

Here are general steps to run any of the scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/veronica-coulombe/practicePythonFiles.git
cd practicePythonFiles

# Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended)
python3 --version

# To run a script, for example simpleCalculator:
python simpleCalculator.py

# Or for storyGame:
python storyGame.py

# For arcade.py (if it depends on external libraries):
# Install needed dependencies (e.g. arcade library) first
pip install arcade
python arcade.py
```

You may need to adjust depending on your Python version, OS, or whether certain libraries are required.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3 (core language)  
- Standard library modules (input, output, control flow)  
- External library (if used in arcade.py) — e.g. `arcade` for graphics/game logic

## Notes

- These projects are educational/fun – not optimized, not intended for production.  
- Dependencies (if any) are minimal. Check each script’s top comments/imports to see whether you need to install extra libraries.  
- If a script does not run as expected (errors/import missing, etc.), you may need to install dependencies or check your Python environment.
